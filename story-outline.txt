You turn up at the hospital unconcious with amnesia.
The sort of bumling incompentant doctor diagnoses you with a brain tumor. You have 1 year to live. You can barely keep concious for the first week or so but eventually stabilize.
Your energy is limited so you can only do one task a day. You soon discover you can enter your own alternate realm thats like the inside of your body. This real is too powerful for you alone.

As you explore the hospital the helpful nurse yells you about the other patients including a woman (Sofia) who's been in a coma for 10 years.
The nurse leaves and you hold the patients hand, shed a tear, and are warped into that patients biona realm. You become friends with her and help her escape her biona realm and defeat the cause of her coma (damaged cells?). She then awakens from her coma but is still weak to stays at hospital. She is now available to take on future missions into the biona verse. Her biona immune cell is the B-Cell.

The friendly boy from the bed across has a sudden downturn and it's not looking good. You and Sofia decide to try and enter the boys realm together and succeed. Over the coming days you beat the poisend cell enemies and come to realise the boys sweet mother has been poisoning him all along (munchosens syndrome). After dropping enough hints the doctor tests for poison and the mother is arrested.
The boy now has no parents so decides to hang out with you guys and beat monsters and cure people.

Eventually you are strong enough to tackle your own brain tumor with the support of your friends. Maybe add an ending where you just die if you run out of time. Maybe the ending is you dying but saving all those other people at the hospital?
